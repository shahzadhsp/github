4. Find your phone's IP address in Settings > About Phone > Status > IP Address.
5. Back in the command line or Terminal, type: adb connect your-ip


If you are unable to connect in wireless mode try the fixes listed on this site:

This method works for most of the devices(tested on 2):
first connect your mobile via cable and turn on developer mode and wireless debugging
then type this command in powershell
adb devices
the connected device's Id will be shown, copy it.
then type this command in powershell
adb -s <YourDeviceId> tcpip 5555
then type the following:
adb -s <YourDeviceId> connect <ip addr>
Note: <> these operators should not be written in command
